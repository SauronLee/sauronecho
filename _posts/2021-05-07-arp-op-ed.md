In my latest op-ed, I argue that cash assistance policies (the expanded Child Tax Credit and $1,400 checks) were some of the most popular and effective parts of the American Rescue Plan; that they would have been even better if closer to universal basic income; and that we should double down on those cash successes with a permanent child allowance and carbon dividend.
