*At the UBI Center, we believe that high-quality, open source research is critical to understanding the effects of universal basic income policies and how to design them. Your contribution helps make this important work possible.*

#### Direct

Support the UBI Center's research through an unrestricted gift.

#### Tax-deductible

Support the UBI Center's research via the [Policy Simulation Library](https://opencollective.com/psl).[^overhead]
Please let us know about your gift at [contact@ubicenter.org](mailto:contact@ubicenter.org) so that it can be routed appropriately.

[^overhead]: Policy Simulation Library's fiscal sponsor charges a 10% fee, so if your marginal tax benefit is less than 10%, you can help us more with a 90% non-tax-deductible gift (consult a financial advisor).

#### Funding direct cash transfer programs

The UBI Center does not run direct cash transfer programs or guaranteed income pilots.
If you'd like to relieve poverty with cash, we recommend donating to [GiveDirectly](https://donate.givedirectly.org/), specifically their Africa programs (their default option).
